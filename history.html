                <p class="p-1 text-justify " > There are the two different views of how programs differ from projects. In one view, projects
                    deliver outputs, discrete parcels or "chunks" of change;[4] programs create outcomes.[5] In this
                    view, a project might deliver a new factory, hospital or IT system. By combining these projects with
                    other deliverables and changes, their programs might deliver increased income from a new product,
                    shorter waiting lists at the hospital or reduced operating costs due to improved technology. The
                    other view[6] is that a program is nothing more than either a large project or a set (or portfolio)
                    of projects. In this second view, the point of having a program is to exploit economies of scale and
                    to reduce coordination costs and risks. The project manager's job is to ensure that their project
                    succeeds. The program manager, on the other hand, is concerned with the aggregate outcome(s) or
                    end-state result(s) of the collection of projects in a particular program. For example, in a
                    financial institution a program may include one project that is designed to take advantage of a
                    rising market and another that is designed to protect against the downside of a falling market. The
                    former seeks to leverage the potential upside; the latter to limit the possible downside. Consider a
                    simple analogy: Fix-A-Flat®. This highly pressurized aerosol product injects a leak sealant into a
                    punctured tire to stop the outflow of air (project A) and concurrently re-inflates the tire (project
                    B), resulting together in the outcome that is a tire that is once again functional (the program
                    comprised projects A and B).[7]</p>
